# Machine Learning Homework 1 - Decision Tree Models

## Description
This repository contains the first assignment for the Machine Learning course. The assignment includes the implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest models for both regression and classification tasks. The analysis involves various preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, model implementation, evaluation, and comparison with sklearn models.

### Files Included
- **ML_HW1.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for the assignment, including data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and visualizations.
- **ML_HW1.html**: HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing without needing to run the notebook.
- **assignment-1-data.csv**: CSV file containing the dataset used for the analysis.
- **Assignment 1.pdf**: PDF document providing detailed information about assignment instructions.


### Data
The dataset used in this assignment is provided in the `assignment-1-data.csv` file. The dataset includes various features related to electronic products, such as brand, screen size, processor, GPU, and price, which are used for both classification and regression tasks.

### Analysis
The analysis is divided into several sections:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the relationships between different features and the target variables.
- **Model Implementation:** Custom implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest models for both classification and regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification, and mean squared error (MSE) for regression.
- **Comparison with sklearn Models:** Comparing the custom implementations with the equivalent models from sklearn.

### Results
The results of the analysis are documented in the Jupyter Notebook and the HTML export. Key findings and model performance metrics are presented and discussed.
